#artist portfolio
By Christine Onaya.
A portfolio landing page for the projects I have done since I started a software development course. The landing page was done entirely using HTML and CSS languages.
This page will provide a platform where all my projects will be posted, thus making it easier to follow up.

In order to get this project just follow this link https://kris-rose-art.github.io/artist-portfolio/

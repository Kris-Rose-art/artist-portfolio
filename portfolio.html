        <h3>About me</h3>
     
        <p>In one word; artistic.</p>
        <p>I am a young lover of fine art, music and well done literature,
            keen to move together with the world's technological evolution.
            As you may have already guessed,I play quite a number of
            instruments; some of which include the violin, the piano and
            the recorder.
            For this reason, I wanted to be able to find and learn ways in which
            I would be able to do the things I love while at the same time
            helping others do the same. That is why I decided to take a class
            on programming, more specifically at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a></p>

            <p class="Education">Education</p>
            <p>I recently completed highschool from the Kenyan education
                system where I was able to interact with people from all
                walks of life thus learning to live and work effectively
                with other people.
            </p>
            <Ol>Here are some of the projects I have done since I joined <strong>Moringa School</strong></Ol>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Kris-Rose-art/musical-fahm.git">Musical Fahm</a></li>
                    <p>This particular project is a website for a music school meant 
                        for people with great passion for music.It uses HTML and CSS languages.</p>

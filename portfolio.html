    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>In one word; artistic.</p>
    <p>I am a young lover of fine art, music and well done literature,
        keen to move together with the world's technological evolution.
        As you may have already guessed,I play quite a number of
        instruments; some of which include the violin, the piano and
        the recorder.</p>
        
    <p>For this reason, I wanted to be able to find and learn ways in which
        I would be able to do the things I love while at the same time
        helping others do the same. That is why I decided to take a class
        on programming, more specifically at <em>Moringa School.</em>

        <p>Education</p>
        <p>I recently completed highschool from the Kenyan education
            system where I was able to interact with people from all
            walks of life thus learning to live and work effectively
            with other people.
        </p>
        <ul>Here are some of the projects I have done since I joined <strong>Moringa School</strong></ul>
